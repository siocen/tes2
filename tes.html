<p><span style="font-size: large;">There&rsquo;s a wide variety of different weapons to choose from in Bowmasters, and all of them function very differently from one another. To figure out which weapon works best for you, you&rsquo;ll want to take the time to try all of them out. Additionally, we&rsquo;ve broken them down into categories below to help you choose which weapons to try first in Bowmasters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">Circular Weapons/Rotating Projectiles: These include Arnold&rsquo;s Tomahawk and Terrance&rsquo;s Chainsaw in Bowmasters. The projectiles shot from these weapons are heavier and larger than straight projectiles, meaning they fly slower. However, because of their size, they&rsquo;re great for landing hits (even if your aim isn&rsquo;t the best). Keep in mind, though, that they actually don&rsquo;t dish out as much damage as straight projectiles even though they&rsquo;re larger and heavier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">Normal Weapons/Straight Projectiles: These include Julius&rsquo; Spear, Robin&rsquo;s Arrow, and Mr. Gorski&rsquo;s Flag, among many others. These are the standard weapons you&rsquo;ll play with in Bowmasters, and they feature slim, straight projectiles. These projectiles are somewhat small in size, and typically fly straight. Because of this, they can be hard to hit targets with. However, when you do land a hit, they deal serious headshot damage. Once you&rsquo;ve honed your accuracy in Bowmasters, we definitely recommend playing with this particular class of weapons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: large;">Special Weapons/Special Projectiles: Now, these are very unique weapons in Bowmasters that take act as a mixture between the aforementioned weapon types. Included in this category are weapons like Kacey Twitch&rsquo;s Gamepad and Ron Etienne&rsquo;s Magic Card. Special Weapons blend together straight and rotating projectiles, and often have special abilities that can be activated by tapping your screen again while the projectile is in the air. They&rsquo;re great to use when you&rsquo;ve become accustomed to the other weapon types, and are extremely fun to play with as they help change things up.</span></p>
